# Green Valley School District Proactive Student Support Initiative - Problem Child AI

The Green Valley School district wants to take a proactive approach to helping their students thrive. As a middle school, they realize that it is critical that children between 11 and 15 get the help that they need. They want to identify and reach out to children that may be in need of additional assistance and/or emotional support in the hopes that this loving support will help them on their way to living a fruitful life. They want to leverage AI to help them accomplish this goal.

## Green Valley Middle School - Students and Faculty

- **Average Enrollment**: 900
- **Number of Teachers**: 65
- **School Counselors**: 3
- **School Nurse**: 1
- **School Security Guards (SRO's)**: 3

Acknowledging that there are many factors surrounding a child's ability to seek academic excellence, the Green Valley Middle School has set up a Student Advisory Committee to create the baseline requirements for this new automated AI detection program geared towards identifying students before they turn into problem children.

### Our Task 

Our task is to facilitate the creation of the new **"Problem Child AI"** system. Our goal is to create a new system that aligns with the list of requirements that were laid out by the Student Advisory Committee. We will generate (3) ai models that use different algorithms and average the PC score. We will also make all (3) independant values (Opinions) available.

### Key Area

1. **Academic Performance**: Sudden decline in grades, missing assignments, or consistently underperforming compared to their previous work.

2. **Attendance Issues**: Frequent absences or tardiness, which could indicate problems at home, lack of engagement, or health issues.

3. **Social Isolation**: Avoiding interactions with peers, sitting alone during lunch or breaks, or having difficulty making friends.

   *No past performance will be evaluated.*

Focusing on the (3) key areas listed above, the **"Problem Child AI"** system requirements are listed below:

- **GPA (Grade Point Average 65 to 100) equal to or below 65 regarded as problematic**
- **(2) or more absences a month (2 lates = 1 absence) a month are problematic.**
- **Participation in Extracurricular school activities (Sports, Glee clubs, Band, Swim, Community Outreach, etc) gains extra credit.**
- **More than 1 trip to the Nurse in a month. Regarded as problematic.**
- **Run-ins with the SRO's - any number above 0 is too many and causes a reduction.**
